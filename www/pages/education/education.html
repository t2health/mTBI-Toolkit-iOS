                                        <p class="ui-li-desc mtbi-font-large">After a blast exposure, jump injury, car accident or other way that you might get a head injury, your neck may have experienced some trauma as well. Some people recover quickly from this type of injury, while others continue to have pain or stiffness in their necks related to poor posture. This neck pain can become head pain.</p>

                                        <p class="ui-li-desc mtbi-font-large">Ice your neck and head at least two to three times a day. Leave it there as you relax for about 20 minutes (or until the pack is no longer cold). Heat is good for relaxing muscles. You can use a warm gel pack. A 10–20 minute shower works just as well. Most respond to ice better than heat. Try both to see which one works best for you. When using heat or ice with neck stretches, use heat to relax muscles before stretching, then use ice after stretching to calm the muscles.</p>

                            </li>
                            <li>1. Get seven to eight hours of sleep. Keep a quiet, cool environment; go to sleep at the same time nightly; no napping; avoid high energy video games, movies and television prior to bedtime; avoid exercise before bedtime</li>
                            <li>2. Write it down. Keep a notebook and pen with you and write things down, it will keep you on track and help remind you of important things, like taking your medication; day planners or small calendars also help</li>
                            <li>3. Avoid alcohol, tobacco, excessive caffeine and energy drinks. These increase sleep problems, anxiety, blood pressure levels and overall stress</li>
                            <li>4. Prioritize. Make a list of things that need to be taken care of, place them in order of importance and check them off when completed</li>
                            <li>5. Get a routine. Put your keys in the same spot every day; park in the same areas; being consistent helps memory and lowers anxiety</li>
                            <li>6. Keep mentally active. Work crossword puzzles; read a book; play a board or card game like solitaire or concentration; try to learn something new every day</li>
                            <li>7. Decrease your stress level. Don’t take on too much at one time; keep stress to a minimum; stress hormones can damage your brain and add to depression and anxiety; learn to say “no” when feeling overwhelmed; it’s also OK to ask for help when you need it; make time for you</li>
                            <li>8. Stay physically active. Take the dog for a walk; take the stairs instead of the elevator; small spurts of exercise add up; the higher blood flow to your brain helps promote cell growth; exercising is also a mood booster and helps with mental clarity</li>
                            <li>9. Feed your brain. Eat high quality foods at regular intervals; fish, colorful fruits and veggies, milk, eggs, whole grain breads, nuts and beans all help to keep the brain and body healthy</li>
                            <li>10. Avoid further brain injury. Consider swimming, walking or running instead of playing football or boxing; wear a helmet when riding your bike or motorcycle; drive safely; stay sober</li>
