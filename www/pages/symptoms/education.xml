					<p>This fact sheet summarizes the clinical recommendations contained in the Driving Following Traumatic Brain Injury: Summary of Clinical Recommendations report that is a result of the DCoE Driving Evaluations After TBI Conference.</p>
	
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Goal: To ensure that those who have sufficiently recovered from all severities of TBI have the opportunity to safely drive government and privately owned vehicles in accordance with federal and state guidelines</strong></li>
						<li>Safe operation of a motor vehicle is a complex task requiring interaction of operational, cognitive and higher executive functions and perceptual abilities</li>
						<li>A TBI can disrupt the complex interplay of functions</li>
						<li>Individuals with all severities of TBI may be at risk for developing symptoms that affect fitness to drive</li>
						<li>A driving evaluation is a two-step process—Step One: Driving Screening and Step Two: Driving Assessment</li>
						<li>A driving screening should be considered for every individual with a TBI</li>
						<li>A driving screening may be performed by any qualified clinician who has experience and knowledge to evaluate those domains listed on the next page in Step One: Driving Screening</li>
						<li>A comprehensive driving assessment is usually reserved for patients whose driving screening results raise concerns or based on clinical judgment, is warranted</li>
						<li>A comprehensive driving assessment is performed by clinicians with driver rehabilitation training and education and TBI experience</li>

				<item title="What is a driver rehabilitation specialist?" parentId="dd-intro"><![CDATA[
					<p>A driver rehabilitation specialist is one who plans, develops, coordinates and implements driving services for individuals with disabilities. Driver rehabilitation specialists are often occupational therapists, physical therapists, kinesiotherapists, psychologists and driver education specialists who undergo additional training in driver rehabilitation. While many driver rehabilitation specialists may hold a specific certification or are in the process of obtaining the necessary education and experience, certification is not required to practice driver rehabilitation.</p>

				<item title="Where are driver rehabilitation specialists located?" parentId="dd-intro"><![CDATA[
					<p>Several military treatment facilities, hospitals and clinics throughout the VA and DoD have driver rehabilitation specialists on staff and may offer driver rehabilitation services. To determine if your facility offers these services or if your patient needs a referral outside of your facility, contact your rehabilitation services department.</p>

				<item title="Introduction" parentId="headacheEx-group"><![CDATA[
					<p>After a blast exposure, jump injury, car accident or other way that you might get a head injury, your neck may have experienced some trauma as well. Some people recover quickly from this type of injury, while others continue to have pain or stiffness in their necks related to poor posture. This neck pain can become head pain.</p>]]>
				</item>

				<item title="Ice/Heat" parentId="headacheEx-group"><![CDATA[
					<p>Ice your neck and head at least two to three times a day. Leave it there as you relax for about 20 minutes (or until the pack is no longer cold). Heat is good for relaxing muscles. You can use a warm gel pack. A 10–20 minute shower works just as well. Most respond to ice better than heat. Try both to see which one works best for you. When using heat or ice with neck stretches, use heat to relax muscles before stretching, then use ice after stretching to calm the muscles.</p>

					</style>

					<p>Consider how you sleep: on your stomach, back, side? Now take away the pillow, bring your arms to your sides, and sit up. How does your neck position look? Is it twisted and strained? Does is look or feel like a good position to keep your neck for six to eight hours every night? And, keep in mind, flipping to the other side doesn’t make it &quot;even!&quot;</p>
					<p><strong>Directions:</strong> First, lying on your side is where to start. Then, consider your pillow. Neutral is the key.</p>
					<p>Next, as you lie on your side on your neutral pillow, pull your entire body completely straight. Once your neck is straight, rest your arms, bend your knees, relax your body to a comfortable position. RECHECK your neck position. Most people tend to curl up once they relax. If you have tucked your chin, pull your neck back up. This might feel awkward to start, but will become part of your bedtime routine and natural after about one to two weeks. Here’s how it looks.</p>

					<![CDATA[
					<p>Dizziness is one of the symptoms that you may experience after a head injury.

					buzzing in your ears, ear pain, hearing loss, neck pain/stiffness or headaches.</p>

					<p>The vestibular rehabilitation exercises will likely bring on your typical

			<h3>Concussion/Mild Traumatic Brain Injury Rehabilitation: Mood Changes</h3>

			<p><strong>
				Having trouble concentrating?<br/>
				Easily irritated or on the edge?<br/>
				Feeling overwhelmed, anxious, sad or depressed?</strong></p>

				<ul>
				<li><strong>Understand that this is OK to have these feelings</strong>. There are
				things you can do to help manage these feelings; take deep
				breaths and know that the feeling will pass; do not focus on
				your worries or troubles; do something you enjoy</li>
				<li><strong>This is normal and very common after a concussion/mild
				traumatic brain injury.</strong> Fortunately, these feelings get better
				with time</li>
				<li><strong>Do not call yourself bad names or put yourself down.</strong> You are
				not your concussion/mild traumatic brain injury; life will get
				better; stay positive</li>
				<li><strong>Talk to someone you love or trust about these feelings.</strong> Many
				people have felt the same way you have at some point in time;
				don’t be afraid to express yourself; your health care provider
				can also help, so be sure to share your feelings with him or her
				<li><strong>If you have thoughts or feelings of hurting yourself or
				others, seek emergency care.</strong> You can contact the
				Veterans Administration Suicide Prevention Hotline:
				<a href="tel:18002738255">800-273-TALK (8255)</a>; this number is established for both
				veterans and active duty personnel

			<![CDATA[
			<h3>Concussion/Mild Traumatic Brain Injury Rehabilitation: 10 Ways to Improve Your Memory</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Get seven to eight hours of sleep. Keep a quiet, cool environment; go to sleep at the same time nightly; no napping; avoid high energy video games, movies and television prior to bedtime; avoid exercise before bedtime</li>
				<li>Write it down. Keep a notebook and pen with you and write things down, it will keep you on track and help remind you of important things, like taking your medication; day planners or small calendars also help</li>
				<li>Avoid alcohol, tobacco, excessive caffeine and energy drinks. These increase sleep problems, anxiety, blood pressure levels and overall stress</li>
				<li>Prioritize. Make a list of things that need to be taken care of, place them in order of importance and check them off when completed</li>
				<li>Get a routine. Put your keys in the same spot every day; park in the same areas; being consistent helps memory and lowers anxiety</li>
				<li>Keep mentally active. Work crossword puzzles; read a book; play a board or card game like solitaire or concentration; try to learn something new every day</li>
				<li>Decrease your stress level. Don’t take on too much at one time; keep stress to a minimum; stress hormones can damage your brain and add to depression and anxiety; learn to say “no” when feeling overwhelmed; it’s also OK to ask for help when you need it; make time for you</li>
				<li>Stay physically active. Take the dog for a walk; take the stairs instead of the elevator; small spurts of exercise add up; the higher blood flow to your brain helps promote cell growth; exercising is also a mood booster and helps with mental clarity</li>
				<li>Feed your brain. Eat high quality foods at regular intervals; fish, colorful fruits and veggies, milk, eggs, whole grain breads, nuts and beans all help to keep the brain and body healthy</li>
				<li>Avoid further brain injury. Consider swimming, walking or running instead of playing football or boxing; wear a helmet when riding your bike or motorcycle; drive safely; stay sober</li>
