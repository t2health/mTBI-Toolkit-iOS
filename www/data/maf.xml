        <h2>Scoring</h2>
        <p>To calculate the Global Fatigue Index (GFI): Convert item #15 to a 0–10 scale by multiplying each score by 2.5 and then sum items #1, 2, 3, average #4–14, and newly scored item #15. Scores range from 1 (no fatigue) to 50 (severe fatigue). Do not assign a score to items #4–14 if respondent indicated they “do not do any activity for reasons other than fatigue.</p>
        <p>If respondents select no fatigue on item #1, assign a zero to items #2–16. Item #16 is not included in the GFI.</p>
