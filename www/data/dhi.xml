		<h2>DHI Scoring Instructions</h2>
		<p>The patient is asked to answer each question as it pertains to dizziness or unsteadiness problems, specifically considering their condition during the last month. Questions are designed to incorporate functional (F), physical (P), and emotional (E) impacts on disability.</p>
		<p>
			To each item, the following scores can be assigned:
			<ul>
				<li>No = 0</li>
				<li>Sometimes = 2</li>
				<li>Yes = 4</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			Scores greater than 10 points should be referred to balance specialists for further evaluation.
			<ul>
				<li>16–34 Points (mild handicap)</li>
				<li>36–52 Points (moderate handicap)</li>
				<li>54+ Points (severe handicap)</li>
			</ul>
