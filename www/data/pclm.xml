        <h2>Scoring</h2>
        <p>The PCL is a self-report measure that takes approximately five to ten minutes to complete. Interpretation of the PCL should be completed by a clinician. A total symptom severity score (range = 17–85) can be obtained by summing the scores from each of the 17 items. A diagnosis can be made by: 1) Determining whether an individual meets DSM-IV symptom criteria, i.e., at least one B item (questions 1–5), 3 C items (questions 6–12), and at least 2 D items (questions 13–17). Symptoms rated as “Moderately” or above (responses 3 through 5) are counted as present. 2) Determining whether the total severity score exceeds a given cutpoint. 3) Combining methods (1) and (2) to ensure that an individual has sufficient severity as well as the necessary pattern of symptoms required by the DSM.</p>
