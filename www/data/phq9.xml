                </div>
                <div class="ui-body ui-body-d">
                    <h3>For initial diagnosis:</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Patient completes PHQ-9 Quick Depression Assessment on accompanying tear-off pad</li>
                        <li>If there are at least four ✓s in the gray highlighted section (including Questions #1 and #2), consider a depressive disorder; add score to determine severity</li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Consider Major depressive Disorder</h4>

                                <li>if there are at least five ✓s in the gray highlighted section (one of which corresponds to Questions #1 or #2)</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>Consider Other depressive Disorder</h4>
                            <ul style="list-style:square">
                                <li>if there are two to four ✓s in the gray highlighted section (one of which corresponds to Question #1 or #2)</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Note: Since the questionnaire relies on patient self-report, all responses should be verified by the clinician and a definitive diagnosis made on clinical grounds, taking into account how well the patient understood the questionnaire as well as other relevant information from the patient. Diagnoses of Major Depressive Disorder or Other Depressive Disorder also require impairment of social, occupational or other important areas of functioning (Question #10) and ruling out normal bereavement, a history of a Manic Episode (Bipolar Disorder), and a physical disorder, medication or other drug as the biological cause of the depressive symptoms.</p>

                    <h4>To monitor severity over time for newly diagnosed patients or patients in current treatment for depression:</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Patients may complete questionnaires at baseline and at regular intervals, e.g., every two weeks, at home and bring them in at their next appointment for scoring or they may complete the questionnaire during each scheduled appointment</li>
                        <li>Add up three ✓s by column<br />
				For every three: Several days = 1, More than half the days = 2, Nearly every day = 3</li>
                        <li>Add together column scores to get a TOTAL score</li>
                        <li>Refer to the accompanying PHQ-9 Scoring Card to interpret the TOTAL score</li>
                        <li>Results may be included in patients’ files to assist you in setting up a treatment goal, determining degree of response as well as guiding treatment intervention</li>
                    </ol>
